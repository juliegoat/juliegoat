I learned how to code without realizing it when I start messing around with myspace layouts in 8th grade. I've been diddling around ever since!
I've recently returned to coding for fun instead of business and it's making me happy ðŸ˜Š 

I prefer web dev, love making generative art, and write sloppy code most of the time. I care a lot about documentation, and it's one of the most important things we can do to break down the barrier to entry for the tech field.
